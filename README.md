### BrilliantCode - Your open source AI engineer

[![BrilliantCode](assets/brilliant-code-image.png)](https://jcumoke.com/bcode)

BrilliantCode is an open-source agentic IDE that enables frontier models (including open source models) to build projects for you autonomously. Inside BrilliantCode, an LLM can spin up terminals, control a browser and create/edit files the same way you can as a dev. Transparency and control for human devs and agency for LLMs.
